            <p>
                Smart technology innovations are turning the dream of the smart home into reality. This design challenge explores how a smart stove can impact everyday problems. As a second part to the challenge—I designed a <a href="souschef-app-casestudy.html">companion app</a> that expands the stove’s capabilities and impact. Even after this completing exercise, I have barely scraped the surface of what a smart stove can do. This concept is just the beginning, and that is exciting.

        <h2 class="title-centered">Seeing the Potential</h2>
            <p>
                Samsung’s smart refrigerator <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/explore/family-hub-refrigerator/">Family Hub</a> made its debut in Spring 2016. Featuring a built-in touchscreen and camera, Family Hub organizes home tasks, connects family members, and provides entertainment. Family Hub is not just a high-end refrigerator with technologically advanced features, but as its name suggests, it acts as a medium to connect family members as well as a kitchen assistant. It places itself at the center of family activity.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a design challenge, I wanted to design another appliance to add to Samsung’s line of smart home appliances. Like Family Hub, its impact would apply to everyday lives and be integrated into the home. No longer just an appliance but an assistant in our daily routines.
            </p>

<!-- Why a Stove? -->

        <h2 class="title-centered">Why a Stove?</h2>
        <p>
                I considered a microwave, washer, dryer, lamp, TV and even a bathroom mirror. I ended up choosing an appliance that would create the most impact in everyday life---the stove. The most complex and regularly occurring tasks happen around the stove. I started thinking about a smart stove could do. Create a more enjoyable cooking experience? Yes! Preheat our oven remotely? Definitely! What were the less obvious problems we can solve with this stove? The potential was exciting to contemplate, dream about and explore.

            <p>
                When you’re bringing something new to the table, it needs to be boldly innovative yet delightfully relevant. Realizing that I would be crossing the line from “need” to “want”, I was targeting a niche market. I started thinking about who would want this stove? What problems do they have? What would get them to not only use the stove but love it? 
            </p>
            <p>
                I interviewed 7 individuals varying in income, age, cooking skill level, family size, and tech enthusiasm. Building and refining my hypotheses with each interview, I gained insight to their routines, their daily obstacles, their frustrations in their cooking experiences, and their motivations and obstacles to purchasing a smart stove. I also discussed potential features and learned which they were interested in seeing in a smart stove. Finally, I conducted a mass survey to back my findings.

            <p>
                Sous Chef’s target consumers were early tech adopters who desired more precision or assistance in their cooking process and tasks. They all belonged in the mid to high income bracket. The target consumers broke down into three main groups:
            </p>
        <div class="row">

            <p style= "margin-top: 10%">Their reasons for wanting extra assistance varied. The three main motivating factors were Safety, Precision, and Productivity. These goals drove the design of the smart stove.</p>
        </div>
        <div style= "margin-top: 10%">
            <h3 class="h4-title-centered teal">Safety</h3>
            <p>This was the biggest obstacle and yet the strongest motivating factor at the same time. Having the stove complete tasks for you without supervision sounded scary to some. Forget about a smart gas stove. That’s for sure! However, if the stove proved to be even safer than your stove at home, this was where consumers were more willing to pay a premium for a smart stove.</p>
        </div>
        <div style= "margin-top: 10%">
            <h3 class="h4-title-centered teal">Precision</h3>
            <p>Cooking enthusiasts were most interested in controlling temperature with precision and guidance in managing time more effectively. Again, they don’t want the stove do it for them but rather help them manage time or temperature so that they can focus on building flavor.</p>
        </div>
        <div style= "margin-top: 10%">
            <h3 class="h4-title-centered teal">Productivity</h3>
            <p>Finding time to satisfy the demands of modern life is quite a challenge for many users. Cutting down the number of steps and enabling users to accomplish tasks more quickly would greatly improve their quality of life.</p>

            <p>
                As Sous Chef was breaking new ground, I wanted to get ideas down fast and get to testing early in the process. The project scope focused on the stove’s built-in screen’s UI. However, I did conclude that the stovetop had to have induction burners for anyone to feel safe using the smart features. Next to the screen, users can control burners with touch dials and power buttons as quickly as they would on a traditional stove.

                <h4 class="line-space" style="margin-top:3%">Timed Cooking</h4>
                <p>Sous Chef adds more value to the good old kitchen timer by assigning it to a burner and adding an action after the timer goes off. </p>

            <p>
                Once the concept was ready for feedback, I created a prototype through Invision. I tested the flow and navigation with users on an iPad placed on a surface of a stove to replicate a real environment. Users were asked to completed three tasks: 
            </p>
            <p style="padding-left:3rem">1) Turn on a burner and add a timer</p>
            <p style="padding-left:3rem">2) Cook a steak using the guided sous-vide cooking method</p>

        <div style= "margin-top: 10%">
            <h3 class="h4-title-centered teal">When There Is Information Overload</h3>
            <p>The navigation overall was highly intuitive. The only area where users seemed to stumble a bit was in the Timed Cooking flow. There was too much information and and too many call-to-actions on one page. Half the users took a bit of time to digest the information and figure out what they needed to do.</p>
            <div style="margin-top:7%">
                <img class="u-max-full-width" src="images/ss-stove/test-tmi.png" alt="Image of Timed Cooking Wireframe"/>

        </div>
        <div style= "margin-top: 10%">
            <h3 class="h4-title-centered teal">Sometimes Too Automated Is Too Scary</h3>
            <p>Users found the idea of setting automated tasks for common tasks they perform everyday very useful. However, they were concerned with the possibility of forgetting to cancel a recurring task on holidays or if they forgot to fill a pot of water to heat. </p>

        </div>
        <div style= "margin-top: 10%">
            <h3 class="h4-title-centered teal">Clarity Is Key</h3>
            <p>Users found it confusing as to what they had the option of changing in the carousels. For example, if I am able to adjust the hour as well as the minutes in for the timer, then they need to be separated from each other.</p>

            <h3 class="h4-title-centered teal">Educational Tips</h3>
            <p>While users were able to perform tasks asked of them and navigate through screens successfully, they didn’t always understand how they might incorporate some of the features into their routine. For example, someone who regularly sets a tea kettle to boil in the morning may not know what temperature is ideal for steeping their tea nor are they able to control it easily. Adding tips strategically can empower and educate the user, making our smart features more relevant and easy to use.</p>

            <h3 class="h4-title-centered">A Minimalistic Intuitive Interface</h3>
            <p>As a modern luxury appliance, Sous Chef employs a sleek minimalistic visual language that emphasizes its ease of use and premium quality. The stove’s flat surface free of dials and knobs places the emphasis on the action happening on the surface—the cooking. Its minimalistic appearance creates an environment for the user that is simpler and supports the idea that Sous Chef is managing the behind the scenes (heat, timing, upcoming steps.)</p>
            <p>From the beginning, my goal was to have an interface that was simple and intuitive. The less time the user spends trying to accomplish their task on screen, the more quickly they can get to cooking, the better the experience. Sous Chef is the smart kitchen assistant and not a complicated machine with bloated features.</p>
            <p>To guide users through the smart features and new cooking process, Sous Chef’s interface breaks down information into digestible chunks. The interface employs dimensional controls that mimic the familiar experience of turning a dial or pushing a button. With an intuitive navigation, the interface eases the transition from traditional stove with physical dials and buttons to a flat stovetop with touch controls.</p>

        <h3 class="title-centered">Timed Cooking</h3>
        <p>
                In our interviews, many individuals expressed frustration in managing multiple dishes. There were many sad cases of overcooked pasta and horrifying experiences of burning steaks because they lost track of time or needed an extra set of hands. Some users reported using a timer in their cooking. In this case, users have to attach their own meaning to what should happen after the alarm goes off and complete that action themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
                Timed cooking streamlines this process and allows the user to manage their cooking process more effectively. Each burner can be assigned a timer and gives the option to execute an action after the timer goes off.

        <p>
                Cooking enthusiasts want more precision in their cooking and access to cooking methods that don’t crowd their counter space with single-purpose cooking appliances. With the help of a clip-on thermometer that connects to Sous Chef via wi-fi, Sous Chef can maintain the temperature of a pot. Cooks can sous-vide, deep fry, or heat water at a constant temperature managed by Sous Chef.
        </p>
        <p>
                Knowledgeable chefs can use manual mode to enter the desired temperature and time to cook their meals. The guided mode provides beginners step-by-step guidance to a perfectly cooked meal.

        <h3 class="title-centered">Automated Tasks</h3>
        <p>
                One of the most stressful times of the day is trying to get yourself out the door in time for work. The most common morning tasks included heating water and toasting bread. I saw an opportunity to cut down the number of steps in their morning routine with automated actions scheduled the night before.
        </p>
        <p>
                From testing, I learned that setting a task to repeat was concerning for users. What if they forgot to cancel a task on a holiday and the stove turned on? Instead of recurring tasks, automated tasks became a collection of custom presets. In either case, prep work, such as filling a pot or placing bread in the oven, is required from the user. If the user is required to be at the stove, it made sense for the user to schedule a task at this point of contact.

            <p>
                As an addition to Samsung’s line of smart kitchen appliances, it made perfect sense to family the smart stove brand with Samsung’s Family Hub refrigerator. The smart stove was named “Sous Chef” which captures the stove’s purpose of assisting and enabling the home chef to create quality food.
            </p>
            <p>
                For cohesiveness, Sous Chef adopted Samsung’s brand color palette and type.

           If this were a real product, we would continue conducting tests to see how the interface’s navigation could be improved and observe how people might use each feature. We would also build out and test the onboarding experience. The goal was to make a smart stove that would improve the user’s cooking experience and streamline everyday tasks. I also designed a companion app that expanded upon the stove features, but the stove’s features also needed to be effective as a stand-alone.
         </p>
        <p class="white-type">
            There also is opportunity in exploring how Sous Chef and Family Hub may work together. If Family Hub has access to calendars, maybe Sous Chef could suggest an alternative time for an automated task if a meeting was moved up. Perhaps if Family Hub know all the ingredients it contains, it could automatically check off those ingredients in the recipe you plan to make in the <a href="souschef-app-casestudy.html" style="color: #4b4c56"> Companion App.</a>
        </p>
        <p class="white-type">
        Safety notifications could possibly also appear on other synced smart appliances, your computer or car. As IoT continues to synergize our appliances and connect us to our homes, users will grow more comfortable with appliances managing the behind the scenes. Stovetop sensors could sense if something boils over and turn down the heat immediately.
        </p>
        <p class="white-type">
        Voice control was a feature that didn’t make our MVP but generated some interest. Some users were interested in the ability to control the stove without having to touch anything with their greasy fingers.

        <h2 class="title-centered">The Right Focus</h2>
        <p>
           Designing a new product can seem to have endless possibilities in the beginning. By investigating who would use this product and how, your goals are directed by the needs of the user. If the user doesn’t find your product useful nor worth the price, then why bother. 
        </p>
        <h2 class="title-centered" style="margin-top:10%">Don’t Be Afraid to Re-think Your Ideas</h2>
        <p>
           This project would have easily taken a team at least a year to have a product ready for market. I got a taste of what it was like to break new ground. It meant I was going to make a lot of mistakes and scrap a lot of unsuccessful ideas. There were lots of ideas I thought were brilliant but discovered their flaws in testing. It was a fun and humbling experience. Testing my ideas in the real world gives me insight and leads me to places I would have never considered. The result was a more solid and intuitive product.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title-centered" style="margin-top:10%">Getting Useful Data</h2>
        <p>
           Finding useful data in research is challenging, especially when you have a niche market. A vast majority of those I interviewed and surveyed indicated that they weren’t willing to pay a premium for a smart stove. There was a point where I started thinking that this was a bad idea altogether and considered scrapping this project. However, I remembered that this was going to be a niche market and that meant it’s not for everyone. From interviews, I started to form an image of who my target was and discovered the questions I should be asking. In the mass survey, I added filters to maximize the number of useful responses. It was by no means perfect, but it did weed out some of the unuseful data.
