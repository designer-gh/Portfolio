        <h2 class="title-centered">Your Source for New Dining Experiences</h2>
            <p>
                Pop-up restaurants have exploded in popularity in recent years. Diners in major cities are looking for new dining experiences. Pop-up restaurants showcase unique cuisines and dining concepts. Pop-ups allow diners to connect with their food and the chef in a more intimate setting. With its growing popularity, pop-up restaurants surprisingly don’t have a dedicated website or app that lets diners browse and search for experiences near them. As a design challenge, I researched, designed, tested, and prototyped a web application enables diners to browse and reserve a seat for a pop-up restaurant.

        <h2 class="title-centered">Determining Goals</h2>
        <p>
          To find out who would be using this app and what they would be looking for, I conducted a survey. My goal was to learn:
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left:3rem">1) Who the target user was</p>
        <p style="padding-left:3rem">2) How users typically browse for dining options </p>
        <p style="padding-left:3rem">3) What motivates a user to want to attend a pop-up restaurant</p>
        <p style="padding-left:3rem">4) What makes a successful browsing and booking experience </p>
        <p>From the 42 responses received, I established some patterns and learned what were the obstacles and motivators.</p>

            <h3 class="h4-title-centered teal">Primary Users</h3>
            <p>The adventurous diners we are targeting are working millennials living in metropolitan areas. As heavy users of social media, millennials are also heavy consumers of experiences. Pop-up restaurants come at a higher price point, so we are targeting those in the middle-high to high income bracket.</p>

            <p>Users are browsing on their smartphones almost as often as they are on their laptops. 
                To reach as many users as possible, I decided to design a responsive web application rather than a native app. PopEats needed to be accessible by any device.</p>

            <p>Half of the survey respondents occasionally make reservations online. OpenTable is the most popular app used for reservations probably in part due to its integration to browsing platforms like Yelp.</p>

            I interviewed a few people for further information that help me create personas. This tool kept me on track throughout the design process. I also conducted a competitive analysis to evaluate how others were succeeding or struggling and discover where our opportunities lie.

            <h3 class="h4-title-centered">Feastly</h3>
            <p>Feastly is the biggest competition. As the only other website dedicated to pop-up meals and reservations, their product overlaps with PopEats quite a bit. They do a great job representing each dining experience with great photography and exciting menus. Their useful search filters and intuitive navigation creates a fluid browsing and reservation experience. They also chose a responsive website over a native app. However, Feastly only caters to chefs that choose to host their event on their website. They’re primarily home chefs opening up their homes to strangers or professional chefs offering unique tasting menus.</p>

            <h3 class="h4-title-centered">Eventbrite</h3>
            <p>Most pop-up restaurants utilize Eventbrite for publicizing and booking. Eventbrite caters to private events and doesn’t allow users to browse through listed events. Restaurants have to rely on social media or newsletters to publicize their events. Their template layout is not optimized for a restaurant, which needs to display a menu, large pictures, and a chef bio. For a unique event, pop-ups have a rather generic online presence on Eventbrite.</p>

            <p>Although not intended for pop-up experiences, Yelp is the top source for new restaurants options. There is much to learn and observe from them. While they do have an events section, there is no page dedicated to pop-ups. The key to Yelp’s success is their search features and reviews. However, many users complain that they find it tiring to weed out the ridiculous reviews from the helpful ones.</p>

            <p>
                Starting to think about how pop-up restaurants should be presented, it seemed that pop-ups were somewhere between an event and a restaurant. To add another layer of complication, PopEats as a booking website would also be similar to an online store. After studying other sites that sell products, capture restaurant reviews, or promote events, I realized that PopEats needed to allow the user to get to search as quickly as possible. Many other sites delay the sign up or sign in process until the user has decided to make a purchase. This allows the user to start browsing and minimizes the likelihood that they will drop off before even looking through our site.

            <p>
                There is so much data available to us now that our problem is now having too much information. Filtering has grown to be a necessity to avoid user fatigue. To maximize the number of relevant options, I created filters based on the decision-making factors revealed in our research findings. To reflect pop-ups’ personal experience, we chose a narrative approach. The “What are you looking for?” tab is anchored to the top of the browsing page.

        <p>The survey revealed users’ priorities when searching for a for pop-up restaurants. Location was the first door the user passed through. After that, Cuisine, Price, Ratings, and Date were the next biggest factors in browsing and booking. We made sure these details were clearly depicted both in the browsing and restaurant details pages. When searching for food, images play a big role in attracting users. Appetite appeal is key! </p>

        <h2 class="title-centered">What I Learned from Testing</h2>
        <p>
            I tested the app with five users, watching them discover the intent of the web app, browsing through restaurants, and finally booking a seat. These were my biggest takeaways:
        </p>
    
        <div class="img-centered" style="margin-bottom:10%">
            <img class="u-max-full-width" src="http://placehold.it/800x500"/>

        <div style= "margin-top: 10%">
            <h3 class="h4-title-centered">Payment Security Trust</h3>
            <p>Initially, I did not expect payment security to be a big topic. Several users voiced that they would choose PayPal or Visa checkout rather than enter their credit card as a payment method. User were paranoid of submitting their credit card information because it didn’t seem as secure as the other two options. After hearing this feedback, I started wondering what makes a payment page feel more secure. Even users didn’t really know. The best answer they could give was that it looked more official or “maybe you should add a terms and policy link”. </p>
            <p>Noticing that brand recognition of Paypal and Visa immediately gave users a sense of security, I looked into other third parties that would handle the credit card processing and transactions. I added a “Powered by Stripe” badge to the credit card information section, which informed the user who of was getting and protecting their credit card information.</p>
            <div class="img-centered" style="margin-top:7%">
                <img class="u-max-full-width" src="http://placehold.it/350x600" alt=""/>

        <div style= "margin-top: 10%">
            <h3 class="h4-title-centered">Ratings & Reviews</h3>
            <p>Hardly anyone ever buys a product without first readings its reviews and ratings. In this day and age, it’s so easy to find a review. Sometimes there are too many reviews and it becomes a cumbersome task to sort through the reviews to find reliable ones. In testing, we found that photos are just as important. Photos are also more easy to scan through than reviews and aren’t as subjective. User-supplied photos appear more trustworthy than the polished restaurant-supplied photos. They appear more real and honest.</p>
            <p>If this were a real project, I would explore how we could incorporate images uploaded on social media by diners. It would be a selective collective rather than open to all user uploads. If there are too many duplicate images, it will grow to be less helpful. For reviews, we would ensure that only those who attended the pop-up would be able to leave a rating and review.</p>

        <h2 class="title-centered">Recording the Test</h2>
        <p>
           This was my first time using Lookback with Invision. Getting a recording of the user’s face, voice and screen gave me real insight as to how intuitive our design was. The nonverbal feedback is just as if not more telling of how much of a challenge or breeze it is navigating the app. Without recordings, I would have missed a few puzzled frowns or pauses. 
        </p>
        <h2 class="title-centered" style="margin-top:10%">Designing for All Users</h2>
        <p>
           Designing for different types of users is a challenge. Creating an app that is bloated with features to fit every need is not effective. This is where you need to be real and think about where the product’s goals and the users’ goals overlap. The product’s goal is to get user to discover how they can use Sous Chef and expand Sous Chef’s capabilities further into the lives of its users. This was how I determined which user goals to focus on. Simplicity is key if you don’t want to lose users.
