            <p>
                This is the second part of the <a href="souschef-stove-casestudy.html">Sous Chef smart stove </a>design challenge. Early in the process, I intended to build a companion app for the Sous Chef stove. A companion app would connect the smart stove to the user in and outside the home. Connected to the user at all times, the stove could be involved earlier in the cooking process. It could assist in recipe finding, shopping, and finally meal prep. Additionally, geolocation allowed for more effective safety features. It could sense when users were outside the home and alert them if there was any unsupervised activity. The Sous Chef stove is effective on its own. However, the companion app expands its impact and convenience.

                From <a href="souschef-stove-casestudy.html">research</a>, I observed three factors that motivated our target consumers to buy smart stove. These factors guided the design of the companion app. Utilizing geolocation and push notifications, we were able to take safety to a whole new level. Smart recipes designed for and integrated with the Sous Chef stove streamlines the entire meal prep process.

        <p>
                Users are encouraged to download and pair their stove with the companion app during the onboarding process of the stove. However, since this action is optional and may be skipped, the companion app’s onboarding needed to sell the user of its convenience and relevance. With a multi-step setup process, the onboarding process aims to guide the user with clarity, providing feedback and keeping the user informed.

            <p>
                There were many iterations of the dashboard’s design. I started sketching rough ideas, exploring content, hierarchy, and style. I wanted the design to mimic the stove’s minimalistic design. They should feel like they are fully integrated visually as they are functionally. Earlier rounds of the dashboard’s design were more obscure. The design was minimalistic but sacrificed intuition. In testing, I learned that it wasn’t obvious that you could preheat the oven remotely. I updated the dashboard so that all features were displayed visibly on the dashboard.

            <p>
                Many users experience the most stress daily from dinner preparation. They often choose quick & easy meals like casseroles or one-pot meals. Having the oven pre-heated and ready to bake saves the user an average of 10-15 minutes.

        <p style="margin-top:15%">Our days don’t always go as planned. The app will notify the user 5 minutes before it start pre-heating and give them the option to delay the ready time by 10 minutes. If they want to delay the time by another increment, they can do so in the app. I provided a 2-step delay option for cases where their full attention isn’t available.

        <h2 class="title-centered">Smart Recipes</h2>
        <p>In research we observed two types of cooks. The advanced home cook wanted more control of the cooking process. They were interested in adding precision, setting reminders, or learning new cooking techniques. The other user was a busy body who had other priorities to attend to and limited time to spend cooking. They were interested in minimizing the amount of management required in cooking and cutting out steps. We created a section in the app called Smart Recipes. These recipes would be designed for and integrated with the Sous Chef stove. 
        </p>
        <p>The first round of design attempted to create separate cooking experiences for these two users.

            <p style= "margin-top: 10%">In testing, I recorded users navigating our app through Invision and Lookback. From our test results, I found that the two cooking options confused users. They didn’t understand what the difference was. Practically speaking, the Sous Chef stove could probably only automate a selection of recipes rather than all. The idea of having two cooking options for each recipe was unsuccessful.</p>

                <p>I scrapped these ideas and went back to the drawing board. I asked myself, “What is this section of the app trying to achieve?” The purpose of the app is build on the convenience and accessibility of Sous Chef. The app also gave us the opportunity to educate users on how to utilize the smart features. I established new goals:</p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 20%"> I wanted to show the users the potential of smart features timed cooking and temperature control. The features are there but users might not have recipes that take advantage of them.</p>

                    <p>Integrating stove controls and timers into the instructions of recipes saves the user from switching between the recipe instructions and the stove controls. </p>
                </div>
                <p style="margin-top:15%">The idea behind meeting the needs of both advanced and busy chefs wasn’t incorrect. However, a better solution may be creating different recipe collections such as “Cook with Sous-Vide” or “Sous Chef-Made Meals” that would address the specific goals of each group. For our exercise, we focused on how stove controls would integrate with a recipe.</p>

                <h3 class="h4-title-centered teal">Integrating the Stove to Recipes</h3>
                <p>In the first version of the re-design, action buttons were embedded in the instructions where they were relevant. While this accomplished the goal of streamlining the process, I wanted give give the user more feedback and control.</p>

        <p>
           This was my first time using Lookback with Invision. Getting a recording of the user’s face, voice and screen gave me real insight as to how intuitive our design was. The nonverbal feedback is just as if not more telling of how much of a challenge or breeze it is navigating the app. Without recordings, I would have missed a few puzzled frowns or pauses.

        <h2 class="title-centered" style="margin-top:10%">Designing for All Users</h2>
        <p>
           Designing for different types of users is a challenge. Creating an app that is bloated with features to fit every need is not effective. This is where you need to be real and think about where the product’s goals and the users’ goals overlap. The product’s goal is to get user to discover how they can use Sous Chef and expand Sous Chef’s capabilities further into the lives of its users. This was how I determined which user goals to focus on. Simplicity is key if you don’t want to lose users.
