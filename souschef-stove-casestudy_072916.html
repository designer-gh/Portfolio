            <p>
                Smart technology innovations are turning the dream of the smart home into reality. This design challenge explores how a smart stove can impact everyday problems. As a second part to the challenge—I designed a <a href="souschef-app-casestudy.html">companion app</a> that expands the stove’s capabilities and impact. Even after this completing exercise, I have barely scraped the surface of what a smart stove can do. This concept is just the beginning, and that is exciting.

<!-- Seeing the Potential -->

            <p>
                Samsung’s smart refrigerator <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/explore/family-hub-refrigerator/">Family Hub</a> made its debut in Spring 2016. Featuring a built-in touchscreen and camera, Family Hub organizes home tasks, connects family members, and provides entertainment. Family Hub is not just a high-end refrigerator with technologically advanced features, but as its name suggests, it acts as a medium to connect family members as well as a kitchen assistant. It places itself at the center of family activity.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a design challenge, I wanted to design another appliance to add to Samsung’s line of smart home appliances. Like Family Hub, its impact would apply to everyday lives and be integrated into the home. No longer just an appliance but an assistant in our daily routines.

<!-- Why a Stove? -->

        <h2 class="title-centered">Why a Stove?</h2>
            <p>
                I considered a microwave, washer, dryer, lamp, TV and even a bathroom mirror. I ended up choosing an appliance that would create the most impact in everyday life---the stove. The most complex and regularly occurring tasks happen around the stove. I started thinking about a smart stove could do. Create a more enjoyable cooking experience? Yes! Preheat our oven remotely? Definitely! What were the less obvious problems we can solve with this stove? The potential was exciting to contemplate, dream about and explore.

<!-- Uncover Problems -->

        <h2 class="title-centered">Uncover Problems <br>Before Solutions</h2>
            <p>
                When you’re bringing something new to the table, it needs to be boldly innovative yet delightfully relevant. Realizing that I would be crossing the line from “need” to “want”, I was targeting a niche market. I started thinking about who would want this stove? What problems do they have? What would get them to not only use the stove but love it? 
            </p>
            <p>
                I interviewed 7 individuals varying in income, age, cooking skill level, family size, and tech enthusiasm. Building and refining my hypotheses with each interview, I gained insight to their routines, their daily obstacles, their frustrations in their cooking experiences, and their motivations and obstacles to purchasing a smart stove. I discussed potential features and learned which they were interested in seeing in a smart stove. I heard firsthand what was expected and necessary in a smart stove and what wasn’t useful. Finally, I conducted a mass survey to back my findings.

<!-- Research Findings -->
<div class="cs-section learned-bg "> 
    <div class="container border-box"> 
        <h3 class="title-centered">Observations</h3>
        <h4 class="line-space">Assistance Over Automation</h4>
        <p>Cooking enthusiasts want more control over their cooking rather than less. They wanted an assistant that enabled them as the “executive chef” versus a robot that took over the entire cooking process. 
        </p>
        <h4 class="line-space">Points of Stress</h4>
        <p>The most stressful times of the day occur when trying to get out the door in the morning and getting dinner ready on time. The features of Sous Chef largely focused on alleviating these points of stress.
        </p>
        <h4 class="line-space">Safety First</h4>
        <p>Sous Chef had to prove to be safe first before consumers would consider any of its smart features. Parents with young kids and adults with elderly parents especially are safety-conscious. In fact, safety was the strongest motivator for paying the premium for a smart stove. 
        </p>
        <h4 class="line-space">Task Management</h4>
        <p>Managing the stove, following a recipe, and meal planning while trying to watch young children and complete house chores…modern life gets busy. People are looking for ways complete tasks more easily and increase control over their time. Many use timers while they multitask, and sometimes forget which timer was set for which task.
        </p>
        <h4 class="line-space">Routine Opportunities</h4>
        <p>There is a lot of water boiling and toasting happening in the morning. I aimed to cut down the number of steps in morning routines and get the user out the door more quickly.

            <p>
                Sous Chef’s target consumers were early tech adopters who desired more precision or assistance in their cooking process and tasks. They all belonged in the mid to high income bracket. The target consumers broke down into three main groups:
